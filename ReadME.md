# XP Core Values Implemented:

## Communication:

Communication is the key role in our team. We had scrum calls once a week, We used to discuss the progress work completed by each team member,

listed down the pending tasks from previous week and then plan task for next week.

## Feedback:

From the beginning of the project we used to take feedback on one's individual work from the other team members.

Also feedback was given to others in the team. This helped in understanding the functionality of the application and improving the code quality.

Code has been committed to master after proper review and feedback from the team.

From the beginning of the project each team member had valued others opinion and also considered others ideas and suggestions and respected each others.
